# MealTracker

Meal Tracker does what no app has done before -- track your food! (Just kidding, tons of apps do that. But this one is special. This one was used to learn basic implementation of piping and separation of logic in the context of Angular.)

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [Bower](https://bower.io/)
* [Angular2](https://github.com/angular/angular)
* [Angular-CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)

## Installation

**Step 1**: Clone this repository to your local computer

```console
git clone https://github.com/katharynreed/meal-tracker
```

**Step 2**: Install all development and production dependencies from the project root directory

```console
npm install
```
```console
bower install
```

**Step 3**: Use Angular-CLI to run a local server instance

```console
ng serve
```

**Step 4**: Visit the app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

## More information on development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Planning

1. Configuration/dependencies
  * Install **bootstrap** and save as a dependency in bower.json for easier styling
  ```console
  bower install bootstrap --save
  ```
  * Add **bootstrap** to angular-cli.json under "styles"

2. Specs
  * **Spec 1**: Users can create a food to track by name, calories, and details of a food
  * **Spec 2**: If user does not input name or calories of food they will be unable to submit track request
  * **Spec 3**: Users can view a full list of all foods
  * **Spec 4**: Users can edit individual foods
  * **Spec 5**: Users can sort food entries by calorie count

3. Integration
  * `food.model`: model for `food` objects
  * `app.component`: base page looping through all entries
    * `new-food.component`: component to add new log entries
    * `food-detail.component`: component loaded for each `log` object to display details
      * `edit-food.component`: component on each `log-tile` to allow editing of specific `log` objects
    * `calorie.pipe`: custom pipe to sort `log` objects

4. UX/UI
  * Include bootstrap
  * Develop custom style

5. Polish
  * Make README awesome
